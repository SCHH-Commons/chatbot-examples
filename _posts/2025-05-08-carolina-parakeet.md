# Brilliant Plumes, Silent Forests: The Story of the Carolina Parakeet

`image src=/static/images/Carolina_Parakeet.png .right`

**Introduction – A Flash of Green and Gold:** In a long-ago Southern swamp, the air once rang with shrill chatter as flashes of emerald and saffron darted between cypress trees. These were Carolina Parakeets – the only native parrot of the eastern United States – gathering by the hundreds in verdant flocks. Early settlers and Indigenous peoples alike marveled at (and sometimes cursed) these noisy, colorful birds. Yet today, not a single wild Carolina Parakeet remains. By the mid-20th century, this vibrant species had vanished, leaving behind only skins in museums and stories in history books. What happened to these beautiful “green birds,” and what legacy did they leave? This narrative traces the Carolina Parakeet’s natural history, its tragic extinction, and the lessons it holds for us now.

## Description and Ecology of an American Parrot

The Carolina Parakeet (*Conuropsis carolinensis*) was a small but striking parrot, about 13 inches (33 cm) long with a wingspan of roughly 22 inches. Its plumage was a riot of color: predominantly bright green with lighter green underparts, set off by a brilliant yellow head and a bold orange-red face around the bill and eyes. Both males and females sported this same dazzling coloration – males were only slightly larger – and their eyes were encircled by white rings with a pale flesh-colored beak above zygodactyl feet (two toes forward, two back) for gripping branches. In flight, observers saw flashes of gold and green as these parrots swooped in unison. Flocks kept up constant loud calls, earning them a reputation for being *raucous* and conspicuous. Yet when perched among leaves, their green-and-yellow plumage rendered them nearly invisible in the dappled light of the forest canopy.

Carolina Parakeets lived in social groups and were *highly* gregarious. Flocks commonly numbered in the dozens and sometimes up to 200–300 birds, staying together as they foraged and roosted. They nested in hollow trees – giant old sycamores and bald cypresses were favored – where several pairs might nest communally, each female laying 2 to 5 round white eggs in the shared cavity. Come evening, dozens of parakeets would crowd into a single hollow for safety and warmth, stacking together like feathered sardines. This sociability was key to their success in a wild landscape filled with predators, but, as we’ll see, it also proved to be a fatal flaw under human persecution.

**Habitat and diet.** The range of the Carolina Parakeet was remarkably broad – in fact, it was the northernmost-ranging parrot species in the world. It inhabited much of the eastern and midwestern United States, from the Gulf of Mexico north to at least southern New York and Wisconsin, and westward across the Mississippi basin to eastern Colorado. Within this expanse, it favored old-growth forests along rivers and swamps, especially dense bottomland forests of the Southeast. Stands of river cane, thickets of buttonwood, cypress swamps – all provided food and shelter. Large hollow trees were abundant in these primeval forests, offering ideal roosts and nesting sites. One explorer described a Carolina mountain valley literally named for the parakeet: the Cherokee of Eastatoe (meaning “green bird”) lived amidst flocks of the “wild and beautiful” parrots in a verdant valley that later settlers simply called the *Green Bird Town*.

In the wild, Carolina Parakeets had a diverse diet and an important ecological role. They primarily ate seeds and fruits from a wide variety of native plants – including oaks, beech, elm, maple, pine, cypress, and sycamore trees – as well as thistles, sandspurs, and other weeds. Traveling in flocks, they were effective seed dispersers (and sometimes destroyers) in their ecosystem. They were especially fond of the seeds of the cocklebur plant (*Xanthium*), a spiny weed. A flock would descend on a patch of cockleburs and methodically pluck every bur, holding it in one foot while tearing it open with their beak to extract the nutritious seed inside. Farmers actually appreciated this habit, since cocklebur is a nuisance weed – the birds helped keep fields clear of the burs. Ironically, by gorging on toxic cocklebur seeds, the parakeet may itself became toxic to predators: naturalist John J. Audubon noted that cats died after eating Carolina Parakeets, suggesting the birds’ flesh retained poisonous compounds from the seeds. In effect, the parakeet might have been wearing a chemical shield, discouraging would-be predators – a rare trait among birds.

The parrots’ taste for seeds, however, also brought them into conflict with humans. As settlements spread and farms and orchards replaced forests, Carolina Parakeets readily adapted by raiding crops. They voraciously attacked apples, peaches, grapes, and figs in orchards, even before the fruit was ripe, tearing them apart “merely for the sake of the seeds” and littering the ground with ruined fruit. Flocks would swarm grain stacks after harvest; Audubon vividly recounted seeing haystacks *blanketed* with these birds “as if a brilliantly coloured carpet had been thrown over them,” as they pulled out grains and caused tremendous wastage. Curiously, they seemed to ignore corn in the field, but almost no other crop was safe. Understandably, farmers were incensed by these “outrages” and did not suffer them lightly. This would set the stage for relentless persecution of the parakeet in the 19th century.

## Early Encounters and Cultural Significance

The Carolina Parakeet was woven into the natural and cultural history of America long before it vanished. Indigenous peoples knew the bird well and gave it distinctive names. The Seminole called it *puzzi la née*, meaning “head of yellow,” a nod to its golden crown. The Chickasaw knew it as *kelinky*, and the Cherokee word for the parakeet was *Eastatoe* (or *Estatoe*), which was also the name of a Cherokee town in what is now North Carolina. These names hint at the bird’s significance: in one Cherokee legend, the “green birds” shared their valley with the Eastatoe band, living in harmony among the river canebrakes. Feathers of the Carolina Parakeet – a festive mix of green, yellow, and orange – were prized by Native Americans for decoration. Archaeologists have found parakeet bones at pre-Columbian sites far outside the bird’s known range, such as the Cahokia mound site in Illinois and even a site in Ontario, Canada. The best explanation is that Native trade networks carried the vibrant plumage over great distances. The colorful feathers were likely valuable trade items and may have adorned ceremonial garments, linking the parrot to indigenous art and ritual. Thus, the Carolina Parakeet was part of the continent’s cultural tapestry long before Europeans arrived – a creature both useful and symbolically resonant to America’s first peoples.

European explorers were astonished to find parrots in the wilds of North America. The earliest written mention of the Carolina Parakeet dates back to 1583, when an English report on Sir Humphrey Gilbert’s expedition to Florida noted that the New World forests held “parrots” among their wonders. In the 1700s, naturalists began documenting the species. The English botanist Mark Catesby included the “Carolina Parrot” in his *Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands* (published 1731–1743), marking the first scientific description of the bird for European science. Later, famed American ornithologists like Alexander Wilson and John James Audubon gave more detailed accounts. Audubon, in particular, was captivated by the parakeet’s beauty and behaviors. He painted them in lively poses – clinging to cocklebur branches as in the plate above – and described their habits in his 1832 *Ornithological Biography*. Audubon wrote of seeing “hundreds destroyed in a few hours” by angry farmers, as the unwary parrots would circle back to the same spot even after being shot at. He marveled (and lamented) how the survivors “sweep over their fallen companions, screaming as loud as ever, but still return… to be shot at, until so few remain alive”. This almost altruistic (or tragically foolish) flocking behavior – coming back to check on dead or injured comrades – made them exceptionally easy targets for hunters. Audubon’s vivid writings helped cement the Carolina Parakeet’s place in early American wildlife literature, even as he sounded an alarm about their declining numbers.

The parakeet also found its way into early American settlements as a pet. Because they were attractive, gregarious, and could be bred in captivity, some people kept Carolina Parakeets in aviaries and homes. Even George Washington is said to have had a “green parrot,” possibly a Carolina Parakeet, at Mount Vernon. By the 19th century, a small trade in live parakeets sprang up – the birds could be sold to curiosities collectors or kept as local pets. However, this was never on the scale of the Old World parrot trade. In most cases, the Carolina Parakeet remained a wild creature of America’s forests and farms, not domesticated like its tropical cousins. Still, those few that lived with people further spread its fame. A rare 1906 photograph shows a pet Carolina Parakeet named “Doodles,” perched tamely on a man’s cheek – a poignant reminder that this now-vanished bird once knew human affection as well as animosity.

## Decline into Extinction: From Abundance to Absence

For centuries, Carolina Parakeets thrived in a land of vast forests and wetlands. But the 19th century brought sweeping changes to their world. As American settlement expanded west and south, humans inexorably transformed the parakeet’s habitat. **Deforestation** was the first major blow. Timbering and clearing for agriculture eliminated huge swaths of the old-growth bottomland forests that the birds depended on. By the mid-1800s, much of the Eastern forest was gone or fragmented, especially in the Northeast and Appalachians. The parakeet’s range began contracting – “collapsing from east to west” as settlement advanced. John Audubon as early as 1832 remarked on how much rarer the birds had become in areas where they were once plentiful. After about 1860, sightings outside of remote strongholds became infrequent. Essentially, by the late 19th century the species had been pushed into its last refuge: the dense swamps of central Florida. The parrot that once ranged to the Great Lakes and Plains was now mostly confined to the cypress sloughs around the Kissimmee and Okeechobee regions.

If habitat loss set the stage, **direct killing** sealed the parakeet’s fate. Farmers and fruit growers, especially in the Southeast, viewed these birds as crop-destroying pests and shot them on sight. Thousands were killed in defense of orchards and grain fields. The birds’ very nature made them easy prey: their tendency to return to a wounded bird or repeatedly raid the same field meant a single determined farmer with a shotgun could massacre an entire flock. One account noted that a farmer could “kill as many as he pleases” because the parakeets would not abandon their fallen – a “fateful flocking behavior” that hunters exploited mercilessly. In addition to being killed as pests, many parakeets were shot for the **millinery trade** – their multicolored feathers were in demand to adorn ladies’ hats in the Victorian era. During the late 1800s, the fashion for exotic bird plumage (which also devastated egrets and other species) did not spare the Carolina Parakeet. Hunters would shoot them, pluck the bright feathers, and sell them to hat-makers. Museums and private collectors, alarmed by the species’ decline, also collected hundreds of specimens for preservation around the turn of the century. This collecting, though intended for science, further depleted the wild populations.

By **1900**, the Carolina Parakeet was in full retreat. The last verified sighting in the wild outside Florida occurred in 1878 in Kentucky. After that, reports came almost exclusively from Florida’s remote wetlands. Small flocks persisted in the tangled forests around Lake Okeechobee and the Okefenokee Swamp (which straddles Georgia and Florida) – essentially the last holdouts. As late as the 1890s, naturalists in Florida described seeing large flocks with many juveniles, indicating active breeding and a seemingly healthy population. Yet these final refuges could not protect the parakeet for long. Florida’s human population grew, and even swamps were not safe from logging and draining. By **1904**, the end had nearly arrived: that year, the **last known wild Carolina Parakeet** was killed in Okeechobee County, Florida. It was an unceremonious demise for a bird that once ranged over half a continent – shot and mounted, like so many before it.

A few individuals survived in captivity, allowing the species to hang on a little longer in aviaries and zoos. The **last captive Carolina Parakeets** lived at the Cincinnati Zoo. There, a male-female pair named **Incas** and **Lady Jane** were exhibited for many years, delighting visitors with a living glimpse of a vanishing species. Lady Jane died in 1917, and within months Incas died on February 21, **1918**, reportedly **in the very same enclosure that had housed Martha, the last Passenger Pigeon, who died in 1914**. With Incas’ passing, the Carolina Parakeet was effectively gone. For two decades, rumors and hopeful sightings would persist, but no definitive evidence of any wild survivors ever surfaced. Ornithologists held out hope through the 1920s and 1930s – after all, it was hard to believe that no remote swamp held a remnant flock. Indeed, there were tantalizing reports: locals in Florida claimed parakeets were still seen sporadically in the late 1920s, and two clutches of eggs supposedly taken from wild nests in 1927 ended up in a museum, raising the possibility that a tiny breeding population persisted a bit longer. In Georgia, between 1937 and 1938, observers even filmed what looked like three Carolina Parakeets in the Okefenokee Swamp and later reported a flock in South Carolina’s Santee River swamp. These sightings caused a sensation, but upon analysis the film was thought to show escaped pet parakeets, and the Santee report – made by experienced birders – could never be confirmed. Shortly afterward, much of the Santee swamp was flooded for a reservoir, wiping out the area where the birds were allegedly seen. By 1939, the American Ornithologists’ Union bowed to the inevitable and declared the Carolina Parakeet extinct. The **exact date of extinction** will never be known – it’s possible a few hung on unnoticed for a brief time – but certainly by the early 1940s no sign remained. The IUCN Red List ultimately listed the species as officially extinct as of 1920, reflecting how swiftly it disappeared after the turn of the century.

### Why Did the Carolina Parakeet Disappear?

The extinction of the Carolina Parakeet has been called an “avian cold case,” and scientists have sifted through the evidence to pinpoint the causes. In truth, multiple factors combined into a perfect storm of decline. The primary driver was **habitat loss** – the extensive destruction of the parakeet’s forest home for agriculture and timber. This not only reduced available food and nest sites but also forced the birds into closer contact with humans (and thus into more conflict). Next was **hunting and persecution**: as described, farmers, feather-hunters, and collectors killed uncountable numbers, drastically reducing populations by the late 1800s. The parakeet’s habit of returning to aid fallen flockmates tragically accelerated the slaughter, enabling “wholesale” killing of entire flocks in a single location. **Competition and disease** may have delivered the final blows. The introduction of European **honeybees** in America, for example, created unexpected competition for nest cavities – feral honeybees often occupied the same tree hollows the parakeets needed for nesting, possibly squeezing them out of their last refuges. And although it remains somewhat mysterious why the species vanished so suddenly around 1900, one leading hypothesis is **disease**. Ornithologist Noel Snyder speculated that poultry disease (perhaps an avian virus carried by domestic chickens or farm fowl) could have swept through the remaining parakeet flocks. This might explain why even fairly healthy-looking groups collapsed almost overnight in Florida, despite there still being some habitat left and little hunting pressure there at the end. Modern research has not found direct evidence of a specific pathogen in tested museum specimens, and classic poultry killers like Newcastle disease were not documented in the U.S. until the 1930s. Nonetheless, the idea remains plausible – an unobserved epidemic could have gone unnoticed in the sparsely settled swamps. In the end, even if disease sealed their fate, it was humanity that had weakened the species to the brink. By driving the parakeet into small, isolated populations, our actions made any catastrophe – be it a bad winter, a new disease, or further habitat loss – far more devastating.

## Legacy and Lessons of the Lost Parakeet

The Carolina Parakeet is gone, but it is not forgotten. Over 700 specimens – skins, mounts, and a few skeletons – reside in museums around the world. From these, scientists have been able to extract DNA and even sequence the bird’s genome, revealing its closest living relatives (South American conures like the sun parakeet and jandaya parakeet) and tracing its deep ancestry in North America. Genetic analysis confirmed that the species had surprisingly high genetic diversity before it disappeared, suggesting its final decline was extremely rapid, not a slow dwindling from inbreeding. Each museum specimen today is a silent ambassador from a vanished world – a time when flocks of green and gold parrots could be seen in the forests of Carolina and the shores of the Ohio River.

In art and culture, the Carolina Parakeet’s legacy lives on as well. John Audubon’s famous illustration (Plate 26 of *Birds of America*) immortalizes the species in a moment of natural beauty, ensuring that generations know what this bird looked like in life. More recently, artist Todd McGrain created a bronze sculpture of the Carolina Parakeet as part of *The Lost Bird Project*, which commemorates extinct North American birds. One of these sculptures stands at the Arboretum at Penn State, depicting a parakeet with outstretched wings – a poignant memorial to what we have lost. Such tributes underscore the emotional impact extinction can have on our collective consciousness. The Carolina Parakeet’s story has been recounted in countless books, articles, and even songs, often paired with that of the Passenger Pigeon as cautionary tales from America’s past. They serve as stark reminders that even abundant and widespread species can vanish in a matter of decades if we are not careful.

Perhaps the most important legacy of the Carolina Parakeet is the lesson it offers for **modern conservation**. This was a bird that ranged over half a continent, adapted to various habitats, and could even live alongside humans to a degree – and yet it was wiped out by a combination of human greed, ignorance, and indifference. Its extinction helped catalyze early 20th-century conservation movements. By the time of its disappearance, Americans were beginning to recognize the need to protect wildlife. Laws like the **Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918** came just in time to save other species (herons, egrets, birds of paradise) from the feather trade, but too late for the parakeet. Today, the Carolina Parakeet’s tale is frequently cited in discussions about habitat preservation and invasive species control. For example, knowing that even introduced honeybees can unwittingly contribute to a native bird’s decline urges caution in how we manage non-native species. The parakeet also illustrates the unforeseen consequences of treating any native creature as a “nuisance.” In retrospect, had farmers and collectors shown restraint, and had some effort been made to breed and reintroduce the birds, the outcome might have been different. But in the early 1900s, the concepts of **endangered species** and wildlife management were only just emerging. We learned, tragically, that **extinction is forever**.

There is a small silver lining: other parrot species have since colonized parts of the U.S., filling (in a tiny way) the ecological niche the Carolina Parakeet once held. Feral populations of monk parakeets, escaped pet conures, and naturalized red-crowned Amazons now fly wild in some American cities, a mirror image of the native parakeet’s story. And in south Texas, the green parakeet and red-crowned parrot still chirp in the trees – the only native U.S. parrots left, clinging to the edge of their range. Yet these are but echoes. No tropical import can truly replace the Carolina Parakeet in the ecosystems it once dominated. Cockleburs still grow thick along the Mississippi; no flocks of little green parrots descend on them now. The quiet of those swamps and river valleys, once broken by the parakeet’s chatter, is a quieter quiet – a reminder of an absence.

**Conclusion – Remembering the Parakeet:** The Carolina Parakeet’s extinction was a profound loss – ecologically, aesthetically, and culturally. From the accounts of awed Native Americans and early naturalists, we know that this bird brought a special brilliance to the American landscape. Its disappearance left our forests a little duller and our hearts heavier with regret. Yet its story, however sorrowful, has spurred understanding and positive action. We reflect on the parakeet today not just to mourn it, but to educate and inspire. Its *legacy* is a call to value and protect the living tapestry of nature so that no other species is allowed to follow the Carolina Parakeet into oblivion. As we face modern conservation challenges, from deforestation to climate change, the ghost of this green-and-gold parrot urges us to remember that our actions have consequences – and that protecting biodiversity is far easier than trying to rewind extinction. The forests of Carolina will likely never again host flocks of native parakeets, but if their story leads us to save another species on the brink, then the Carolina Parakeet will not have vanished in vain.
