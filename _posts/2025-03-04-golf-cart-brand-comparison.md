### **🔍 Key Takeaways**  

- **🏅 Club Car:** **Most durable, smooth ride, great resale value** but higher cost.

- **🏅 Yamaha:** **Best gas mileage, quietest gas engine**, but fewer electric options.  
- **🏅 Evolution:** **Feature-packed, stock Lithium battery, high-tech dashboard**, but newer brand.  
- **🏅 ICON:** **Street-ready, aluminum frame, high speed**, but parts/service availability varies by region.

### **Which Golf Cart Brand is the Easiest to Modify?**  

If you're looking for a golf cart that’s easy to **upgrade, customize, and modify**, here’s how the major brands compare:

| Brand      | Ease of Customization | Aftermarket Parts Availability | Popular Upgrades |  
|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|  
| **EZGO** | ✅✅✅ **Easiest** | ✅✅✅ **Extensive** | Lift kits, speed upgrades, custom seats, wheels |  
| **Club Car** | ✅✅ **Very Customizable** | ✅✅ **Large aftermarket support** | Lithium conversions, custom lighting, body kits |  
| **Yamaha** | ✅ **Moderate** | ✅ **Decent aftermarket** | Gas engine performance, lift kits |  
| **ICON** | ⚠️ **Limited (Newer Brand)** | ⚠️ **Fewer aftermarket options** | Mostly cosmetic upgrades |  
| **Evolution** | ⚠️ **More Tech-Focused, Less Customizable** | ⚠️ **Limited aftermarket parts** | Battery upgrades, limited aesthetic changes |  

### **🏆 Best for Customization: EZGO**  
- **Why?** EZGO has the **largest aftermarket support**, making it the easiest to modify. There are **tons of third-party parts** for lifts, speed upgrades, controllers, and body kits.  
- **Best Modifications:** **Lithium battery swaps, higher-speed controllers, lift kits, custom seats.**  

### **🥈 Runner-Up: Club Car**  
- **Why?** Club Car also has **good aftermarket support**, but it can be more expensive to upgrade than EZGO.  
- **Best Modifications:** **Speed tuning, lithium conversions, custom bodies, premium seats.**  

### **🔵 Yamaha: Good but Less Popular for Mods**  
- **Why?** Yamaha has fewer electric cart mods available compared to EZGO & Club Car.  
- **Best Modifications:** Gas engine tuning, lift kits.  

### **🚩 Evolution & ICON: Not as Customizable**  
- **Why?** These brands **come pre-loaded with features**, so they don’t have as many **aftermarket** upgrade options. ICON is more mod-friendly than Evolution, but both have **fewer third-party parts available**.  

---

### **Final Verdict**:  
- **If you want the most customizable golf cart, go with an EZGO.**  
- **If you want a mix of reliability and upgrade options, Club Car is a great choice.**  
- **If you want something already packed with features (and don’t plan to modify much), Evolution or ICON might be a better fit.**
